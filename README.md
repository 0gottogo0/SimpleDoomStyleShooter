Simple doom style shooter using raylib.

Right now it is just a simple player controller, no enemies or shooting but I might plan on adding that in the future.

## Dependencies:

Raylib must be installed

## To Build And Run:

```sh
  bash build.bash # Builds the project
  ./a.out         # Runs the output file
```
